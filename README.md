Cloudinary Django Sample Project
================================

A simple web application that allows you to uploads photos, maintain a database with references to them, list them with their metadata, and display them using various cloud-based transformations.

This sample project depends on [Cloudinary's Python library](https://github.com/cloudinary/pycloudinary). 

## Installation

Run the following commands from your shell.

Project cloning and dependent package installation: 

    git clone git://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary-django-sample.git    
    cd cloudinary-django-sample
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Defining Cloudinary's credentials. The CLOUDINARY_URL value is available in the [dashboard of your Cloudinary account](https://cloudinary.com/console).
